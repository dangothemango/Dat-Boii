# Flasq

### The Tech
Flasq is a game written using the HaxeFlixel multiplatform game engine. It should run on any modern computer but may require a Haxe and Flixel installation.

The game is fully contained in the "Flasq" folder in the root directory.

### The Concept
This game was made as the first assignment of Game Development 1 at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The challenge was to create a game based on the phrase "Its dangerous to go alone, take this." With the only constrain being that "this" cannot be a weapon.

In Flasq, you play an agent who was in a plane accident. After landing on the top of an abandoned building, you must find your way to the bottom using nothing but the watter bottle you found on the roof.

### Gameplay
Following traditional platformer conventions, you start each level by exiting an elevator and must find the elevator that will let you continue down the building.

WASD - Move your character
F - Drink from the bottle
C - Interact with coolers and the elevators

Hint: your bottle is never full
